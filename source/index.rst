Introduction
============

Geppetto is a platform made to empower you to explore, visualize and simulate complex biological models such as a cell or even a whole brain.
The documentation is split into two main sections: a guide to help you learn how to use Geppetto and the developers documentation to learn how Geppetto is engineered and how to contribute to it.

Geppetto is a web application and the end user won't generally require to install it in their local system to use it.

A demo deployment of the latest release of Geppetto is available `here <https://live.geppetto.org>`__ while the binaries are available to `download here <https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/releases/>`__.

The following is a list of the websites currently using a custom deployment of Geppetto available on the web:

- `Open Source Brain <http://opensourcebrain.org>`__
- `WormSim <http://wormsim.org>`__
- `Virtual Fly Brain <http://virtualflybrain.org>`__

------------

If you are looking for instructions on how to use Geppetto, check out our user documentation.

If you are a developer interested in contributing to Geppetto, check out our developers documentation.
