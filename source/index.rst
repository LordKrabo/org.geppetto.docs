Introduction
============

Geppetto is a **web-based** multi-algorithm, multi-scale simulation platform engineered to support the simulation of **complex biological systems** and their surrounding environment. Geppetto's integrative approach to biological modeling is at the heart of the `Open Worm project <http://www.openworm.org/>`__.
