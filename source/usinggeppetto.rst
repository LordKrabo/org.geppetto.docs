Getting Started
===============
Once the Geppetto dev instances has been opened, you can begin to load a simulation.  There are two ways to interact with the Geppetto platform:
* Use the GUI buttons to load, control and interact with the simulations.
* Use the console and enter commands to load, control and interact with the simulations.

Using the Graphic Interface Controls
====================================
Loading the Simulation
----------------------
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/1kI749N.png

Select the "Load Simulation" button at the top to open a console to either select a pre-loaded simulation or upload your own simulation file. 

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/DRaae8U.png

Alternatively you can customize the simulation before loading.

Running the Simulation
----------------------
Once the simulation has been loaded, you can start, pause and stop the simulation at any point.

Navigation
----------
The navigation buttons along the left side of Geppetto allow you to change your view of the simulation within Geppetto.  You can reposition, rotate it and zoom in and out.  To reset, just hit the "home" icon to undo rotation or repositioning.  The buttons can be accessed once the simulation has been loaded as well as before, during and after the simulation run. 

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/A2BngUx.png

In addition to the navigation buttons, you can use a mouse to rotate, drag or zoom the simulation.

Selection
----------
3D objects in GEPPETTO consist of Entities or Aspects, and can be selected/unselected by using the select command of the entity as such:
.. code-block:: javascript

	Entity.select()
	Entity.Aspect.select()
	Entity.unselect()
	Entity.Aspect.unselect()

Plotting
=======
Geppetto allows plotting of simulation variables and data using our built in Plot functionality. 

A new Plot widget can be created from the console using the command 

.. code-block:: javascript

	G.addWidget(Widgets.PLOT)

Alternatively *Shortcut Key: Ctl+Alt+P* - Toggles existing plotting widgets, if none exist it creates a new one. 

Plotting widgets can plot variables straight from the simulation, given you are watching the variables at the time
you start plotting it. Each variable will have its own line plot, and it's accompanied by a label to distinguish it
from other variables being drawn. 

In order to plot a Simulation variable, you can use the command 

.. code-block:: javascript

	Plot1.plotData(variable);

Where "Plot1" is the name of the plotting widget that was returned after creation. 

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/PigAtLo.png

Other variables can also be plotted, as a two dimensional array  plotted against x and y coordinates. 
You can customize your line plot and change the dimensions of the axis in your plot, use the "Commands" section
as a reference to see what options you have to modify your plot. 

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/Sf9byfH.png

Setting Legend for Variables
----------
User can modify the legend that is displayed for a variable being plotted using the following command: 

.. code-block:: javascript

	Plot1.setLegend(variable, legend);

Where variable represents the object being plotted, and legend is a string with the new legend to be displayed for corresponding variable. 

If user fails to specify a legend, the instance path of the variable being plotted will be used. 
However, it will only be partially displayed to save space inside the widget. To view the full name of the variable 
user can hover over the legend and a tooltip with full name will appear.

Setting Options
----------
User can modify a Plot Widget settings, including: x and y axis, line plotï¿½s visibility of points and lines.
Create a javascript object in the console specifying the options, and use setOptions() with the created object
to set the options for the Plot Widget. 

The following values can be used to modify a Plot settings.

- yaxis - Object that sets a minimimum and maximum value for the Y axis of the graph. 
  Use {yaxis : { min : 'value', max : 'value'}} to set yaxis.  
  
- xaxis - Object that sets a minimimum and maximum value for the X axis of the graph. 
  Use {xaxis : { min : 'value', max : 'value'}} to set xaxis. 
  
- series - Object that turns on/off lines and points in the graph. 
 
**Example:** 

.. code-block:: javascript
 
 		var linePlotOptions ={
				yaxis: { min : 0,max : 15},
				xaxis: {min : 0, max : 15},
				series: {
       		 			lines: { show: true },
        				points: { show: true }
				}, 
		}

		//set the options for the plot
		plot1.setPlotOptions(plotOptions);

Commands
---------- 
Plots can be created using console commands. For a complete list of commands 
take a look at our :ref:`Console Commands section`

Console
=======
Additionally, you can open a console at the bottom while the simulation is running to make adjustments. 
*Shortcut Key: Ctl+Alt+J*

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/d5CLO9F.png
   View of the open console. 
   
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/ts859ap.png

A complete list of the simulation commands will display by typing help() into the console. The following commands are available in the Geppetto console.

AutoCompletion
--------------
Within the console, the Tab button assists with entering commands.
Tab once, to autocomplete the current word of the command.
Tab twice, to show all the options available.
If autocompletion detected a command with parameters, it will autocomplete the command and place the cursor in between the parentheses where the variables are located.

         @returns {List<Aspect>} - List of aspects         

Aspect Commands
--------
*AspectNode represents a general case, to use commands on own aspect replace "AspectNode" by the name

Watching State Variables
------------------------------
Simulation states can be watched as the simulation is running, give the user the possibility of drawing their results 
as part of a Plot, through our Plotting widget interface.  A simulation must be loaded in order to watch variables
from it. 

Watching State Variables Example
-----------------------------
*Load Lems Simulation, first one from drop-down samples menu. 

Watch two simulation states by using Simulation.addWatchLists(lists) command

.. code-block:: javascript
	
   Simulation.addWatchLists([{name:"hhvars",variablePaths:["example1.hhpop[0].v", "example1.hhpop[0].spiking"]}]);
  
In this case the two states being watched are "hhpop[0].v" and "hhpop[0].spiking". 

Once variables have been added to watch list, use command

.. code-block:: javascript
	
	Simulation.startWatch()
to start  watching these simulation states.

When you have started watching these simulation states you can plot them in a widget to see 
the different values. Refer to the "Plotting" section for more information on how to do this, and 
 
.. code-block:: javascript
	
	Simulation.help()
for more commands to use with variable watch. 

G.runScript(scriptURL) Example
------------------------------
Within Geppetto, it's possible to execute a script consisting of Geppetto commands and 
javascript commands. 

Reference a public URL which contains a series of commands, as in the link in this example and 
run the command with that URL_.
 .. _URL: http://raw.github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.testbackend/development/src/main/resources/TestSimulationScript.js

To save a series of executed commands from console:
* Copy history to clipboard *
* Copy content of the clipboard to a file and put the file in a public folder *
* Get the URL of that file *
* Feed that link to this command. The set of operations specified in the URL will be executed in Geppetto. *


Connecting with Geppetto
========================
There are two ways to connect with Geppetto.  In the lower right hand screen are two expandable areas. Click on the first will open 
an interface to share via Facebook or Twitter. The second opens a contact form to reach the Geppetto team with questions or comments.
